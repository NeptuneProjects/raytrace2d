# 2-D Ray Tracing for Underwater Acoustics

This package provides a simple, 2-dimensional acoustic ray tracing program for underwater acoustics.
The code is adapted from Y.T. Lin's MATLAB code and an early Python translation by Will Harris.

This code is intended for research and is **not optimized** for performance or large-scale applications.
